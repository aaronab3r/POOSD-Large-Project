First, you'll want to clone the repo. You can do this by hitting the green "Code" button and copying the "SSH" section
Then you'll want to hit the command "git clone <copied URL>"
  this will give you an error if you do not have an SSH key setup for GitHub
  To do this, run "ssh-keygen" (you can leave every other prompt blank) and copy the contents of the file created into an SSH key on your GitHub profile

Next, create a .env file and add the database URL as follows: MONGODB_URI="<copied URL>" (where <copied URL> is the database URL; do not commit a file with the database URL)

Now, run "npm install" in the cards and cards/frontend directories

You'll need two terminals for the last part
Run "npm run start" in the cards directory
Run "npm run dev" in the frontend directory
  hit "o" after this boots up and the welcome page will automatically open
